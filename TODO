Split (1) Parsing files from (2) Creating graphs from their lexical structure

Parser:
  in: single file
  out: lexical struct, maybe a hash

  analyze ideas:
    make a full scan with ctags to get all available element types, e.g. functions, modules, structs...
    -> resulting graph knodes can be taged to of a certain type
    -> user could select certain type for graphical representation, e.g. module dependencies vs. subroutine deps in fortran or just list members of C-structs

  implementation ideas:
    use ctags options for scanning on certain language elements (e.g. --f-kinds=sm) to reduce the amount of work (instead of selection elements after a full scan)
