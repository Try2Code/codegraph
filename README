ABOUT CODEGRAPH:
'codegraph' is an analysis tool for PHP-, PERL and Bash-libraries. It scans files from a list and extracts the the functions therein. Then it extracts the body of each function and tries to find any other of the functions found before. If successfull, it genereates an edge from the function which calls the other function (calling function ----> called function). If no function is found, it generates a single knode.
'codegraph' needs the directory $HOME/.codegraph for some files. You can generate is manually or 'codegraph' will do this for you, when it's started the first time.
DOCUMENTATION:
For technical issues I recommend to use 'rdoc -a'. Otherwise use the man page or just  type "codegraph --help".
DOWNLOAD:
PLEASE use the link from the CVS-Repository:
http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=408&release_id=5178
to get the latest source.
INSTALLATION:
    ruby install.rb
copies the library into your sitelibdir and the executabe to /usr/local/bin. If you want to place these files somewhere else, edit install.rb.
Needed libraries are:
        - Ruby Graph Library (rgl), download via rgl.sourceforge.org,
          the Ruby Application Archive raa.ruby-lang.org/project/rgl or
          the codegraph project page (codegraph.rubyforge.org)
        - graphivz package from AT&T, compiled packages are provided 
          for many distros. If you cannot find it, get it directly
          from http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/download.html
        - ctags (with PHP and Perl support, http://ctags.sourceforge.net)

TEST:
try: src/codegraph -F "examples/*.php" inside the $YOUR_CVS_PATH/codegraph

WRITING SCRIPTS USING FUNCGRAPH.RB:
funcgraph.rb can be used within your own scritps, but you have to define INTFunx = Array.new (internal function of a lang) and Home = `echo $HOME`.chomp (for temporal file generation).

PHP-FUNCTIONS:
codegraph is able to scan for PHP's buildin functions. Therefor some files must be generated from the PHP sources of you choice:
cd into the source directory like '/usr/local/src/php-4.3.4 and type:
find -name "*c" -type f > ~/.codegraph/filelist
ctags -x --c-types=f -L ~/.codegraph/filelist | grep PHP_FUNCTION | ruby -ne \'print "#{$_.split(/\(/).last.split(/\)/).first} "\' > ~/.codegraph/php-internal-funx

'~/.codegraph/php-internal-funx' is a single-space-separated list of PHP's internal functions and you can find it in the examples directory (PHP4.3.4); for PERL v5.6.1 you can take the corresposnding file from same directory.
