ABOUT CODEGRAPH:
'codegraph' is an analysis tool for PHP-, PERL, Bash, C and Fortran-libraries.
It scans files from a list and extracts the the functions therein. Then it
extracts the body of each function and tries to find any other of the functions
found before. If successfull, it genereates an edge from the function which
calls the other function (calling function ----> called function). If no
function is found, it generates a single knode.  'codegraph' needs the
directory $HOME/.codegraph for some files. You can generate is manually or
'codegraph' will do this for you, when it's started the first time.

DOCUMENTATION:
For technical issues I recommend to use 'rdoc -a'. Otherwise use the man page
or just  type "codegraph --help".

INSTALLATION:
gem install codegraph

DEVELOPMENT:
I take codegraph as a moving target. I uses it for PHP in the beginning, but
ctags knows a lot languages. So took over Bash and Perl, too. Now is mainly to C and Fortran. That's why I added these two to codegraph. Preprocessing a little bit tricky, but at least for C, it works (hopefully).
If you have any kind of feature wishes, please let me know.
